# using-bootstrap
Rebuild the site Newsweek.com

Using:
- [Normalize v8.0.0](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/)
- [Bootstrap v4.1.0](https://getbootstrap.com/) framework.
- Mobile-first approach (768px first, up to 1280px).


edit: getting bored of recreating website from scratch, i'll eventually finish this project later...
